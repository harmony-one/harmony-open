# **Welcome to Harmony Stake Heist**

Stake Heist is Harmony's adversarial hacking competition that will take place before open staking launch. We are collaborating with Gitcoin. We currently expect competition to go for 2 weeks, but also likely to have some extensions. 

**What are the bounties?**

There are two categories of bounties in Stake Heist:
1. [Exploit](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/labels/exploit): These bounties help us identify vulnerabilities in our design and code. These are open ended and usually include attack vectors and exploits.

2. [Project](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/labels/project): These bounties are projects that are useful for validators and delegators in staking. The requirements for these bounties are more clear (compared to exploits).

**Prizes and judging criteria**

There are three tiers of prize ranges. Each bounty submission could be eligible for any (or all) of the prize tiers. Please check the original bounty posting to see which tiers are applicable.

**Submission process and guidelines**

Exploits:

1. Give us a heads up by clicking ‘start work’ button on the Gitcoin posting for the bounty (Recommended at least 2 prior to submission, especially for exploits that could affect network stability) 
2. Submit the evidence of your work by opening a new issue on Harmony main repo, using the ‘stake heist submission’ template. Make sure to click ‘submit work’ and link your work on Gitcoin.
3. Wait up to 12 hours until our team tags your submission as valid. Please stay in contact with our team in case of additional requests.
4. After a submission is tagged as valid, any further similar submissions will not be eligible for prizes. It is in participant's responsibility to track other valid submissions (note that 'valid' tag does not guarantee rewards)
5. You will receive the final decision of winners within 2 weeks after the competition ends


Projects:

1. Submit a scope approval request by clicking ‘start work’ button on the Gitcoin posting for the bounty. Please include in your request the following: 
    - Short description of deliverable
    - Estimated time to finish (e.g, 2 days)
    - List of functionalities and features
    - Usage (platform, OS, device, standalone, integration, …)
    - Other information
2. Once your scope request is approved by our team (within 24 hours of submission), you can start working on the project. Projects could be finished after competition ends as long as the scope is approved by the team.
3. Submit your work by opening a new issue on Harmony repo, using the ‘stake heist submission’ template
4. You will receive the final decision of winners within 2 weeks after the competition ends OR after work is submitted.
